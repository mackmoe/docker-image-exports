#Portin docker containers like a boss!
The docker composr scripts need the images in order to run.
Download the docker image .tar.gz files and extract them.
Once they are extracted, import them into docker images.
From there, they can be used by the docker compose scripts to build app stacks within containers.

Note
---
Read the README.md in each of the docker compose app dirs so you know how to run the apps
